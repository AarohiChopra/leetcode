/* 
 * Prompt:
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
 * you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits 
 * in each basket. 
 * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
